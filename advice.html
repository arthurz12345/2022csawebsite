<h1>Webmaster/Tech Director (Official CSA Nerd)</h1>

<h3>Basic responsibilities/duties:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Updating/maintining website</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding photos from events, also adding the board photos/bios (search Google Drive/Forms for "board bios", you can change it up if you'd like)</li>
                <li>You don't need to change the website, it's up to you and your creative freedom</li>
                <li>You can either work with the other media team or work more solo</li>
                <li>I originally used a mock up from the creative director (Kathy) as the design for the website, but then I remade it with a more modern and fancy design from a template lol</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Running tech committees when needed</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting speakers for events when needed like tbanq !!!make sure you get subwoofer or music won't sound good!!!</li>
                <li>Cal Poly tech rentals doesn't have speaker rentals anymore so it'll have to be from off campus</li>
                <li>We used Bill Gaines audio in 2021 for tbanq</li>
                <li>Be at least mildly familiar with a mixer board</li>
                <li>Coordinate with performers that need mics/music and make note of the different volumes/settings for each of them since they will likely all have different requests</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Changing slides at general meetings</li>
            <ul>
                <li>JK I just volunteered to do that since we used my laptop</li>
                <li>Even though it's not required, you'll probably end up using your laptop for HDMI for most events just cause it makes sense as tech director</li>
                <li>A mic will be useful if you do hybrid meetings like we did, wireless is 100000x better than the wired one we used which forced us to stand within 3 feet of the laptop</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Aux Duty (making a collab playlist with other board is fun)</li>
        <li>Being part of media team :D</li>
    </ul>

<h3>General Advice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure you update the payment method on the Godaddy account ASAP to one of the board members so they can be reimbursed by treasurer for hosting fees</li>
        <li>The website says "not secure" because they want you to pay ~$60-150 a year for SSL hosting -_- its up to your board if that's worth it, we decided against</li>
        <li>Help out other board members if they need, they'll remember it when you need help</li>
        <li>I hosted an open mic night on zoom, it's a fun way to get to see what everyone can do, in person will be even better</li>
        <li>Taking CPE 357 during your term is not super highly recommended by me but doable if you want to be less than happy for a quarter lol</li>
        <li>You won't be in charge of so many events like the Socials, so join another committee that interests you, it's more fun</li>
        <li>As you probably have heard/will hear, keep your composure and be chill even when you're panicking inside if something isn't working etc. especially in front of general members</li>
        <li>If you ever happen to have a disagreement with another board member, just remember that no matter what you're always on the same team</li>
        <li>Here's Ryan Premi's pairing algorithm for bigs/littles, it's pretty complicated and I didn't use it but you can check it out and use if you want: <a href="https://github.com/rpremi12/PairUp?fbclid=IwAR24Ir4R5z0b_FbhVfLQHhxJzawzNWQNy8_ITjTGbv7mh2THYhKt5HuH_IQ">https://github.com/rpremi12/PairUp?fbclid=IwAR24Ir4R5z0b_FbhVfLQHhxJzawzNWQNy8_ITjTGbv7mh2THYhKt5HuH_IQ</a></li>
    </ul>

<h3>Website Advice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>General Website Stuff:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I use VSCode with Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey, which I highly reccomend</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Live server is better than just opening the html file, since it loads scripts to accurately reflect what users will see</li>
                        <li>Being familiar with VSCode might also help make you feel more comfortable in some CS classes later on depending on your professor lol</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Try to implement lazy loading (I didn't get to that sorry), it'll dramatically decrease load times</li>
                <li>The current website is all in one page, you can split it back up if you'd like</li>
                <li>LOL good luck with the panda logo that contains the "What is CSA" video on the homescreen it's a pain to center for different view widths</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Board Page:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a google form to get board members photos/bio information to put on website</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Previous webmaster used a python script to take a .tsv file from the spreadsheet of responses to write the board page but I didn't (it's a good idea tho)</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Square pictures are easier to work with</li>
                <li>Try asking people to submit photo without mask, it looks nicer</li>
                <li>Downsize the photos to ~100kb so the website loads faster</li>
                <li>Don't forget about performing groups!</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Events Pages:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Again, try to make sure pictures are 100-200kb so the website isn't too slow</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to nag Historian for photos, but go to Facebook first they should be updating it</li>
                <li>The Facebook page has a lot of cool pictures from past years on it, a good resource</li>
                <li>Maybe consider working with some other board members to rewrite some of the event descriptions because some of them might be a bit outdated (low priority if you have time)</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Fam Pages</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Nothing much here, just send out a Google Form to the fam heads once you find out who they are, no rush, you might need to nag them a bit more because they forget LOL</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Calendar</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I used Style My G Cal to make a nicer looking (but slow af) google calendar on the bottom, just sign in with the CSA Gmail if you wanna customize it if you decide to use it</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have any other questions about anything just ask me :D <br>Enjoy your board term as much as you can, the time flies! <br><br>-Arthur Zhao <br>Webmaster/Tech Director 2021-2022</p>
