I build this website over the course of my term as club Webmaster for the Chinese Students Association at Cal Poly from 2021-2022.  It served as a reference for club members, sponsors, and other clubs who we worked with.

It was originally hosted at www.calpolycsa.org in 2022 but has since been replaced so please check it out at it's new home: https://arthurz12345.github.io/2022csawebsite/
